## Year 2020
**Interpretable, Multidimensional, Multimodal Anomaly Detection with Negative Sampling for Detection of Device Failure** [[link](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/poster/6171)]    
*John Sipple*  
> - **Problem**: Unsupervised anomaly detection models are usually ineffective at high-dimensional data.
> - **Method**: First generate "fake anomalies" through a uniform sampling strategy, then train a classifier on them to do detection.

**Detecting Out-of-Distribution Examples with Gram Matrices** [[link](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/poster/6703)]    
*Chandramouli Shama Sastry, Sageev Oore*   
> - **Problem**: Softmax classifiers and generative models are overconfident for OOD examples.
> - **Method**: Assume OOD examples have a different sequence of network states, and use this property to detect anomalies.

**Robust Outlier Arm Identification** [[link](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/poster/5992)]    
*Yinglun Zhu, Sumeet Katariya, Robert Nowak*    
> - **Method**: Proposed a adaptive sampling strategy to detect anomalies in bandit problem.

**Progressive Graph Learning for Open-Set Domain Adaptation** [[link](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/poster/5782)]  
*Yadan Luo, Zijian Wang, Zi Huang, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*
> - **Theory**: Further decompose the error bound on target samples to be: **source risk**, **domain discrepancy**, **open-set risk**, and **shared error on the joint hypothesis**.
> - **Method**: An algorithm which minimizes the aforementioned error.  

## Year 2019
**Anomaly Detection With Multiple-Hypotheses Predictions** [[link](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/nguyen19b.html)]    
*Duc Tam Nguyen, Zhongyu Lou, Michael Klar, Thomas Brox*   
> - **Problem**: Unsupervised anomaly detection models are usually ineffective at high-dimensional data.
> - **Method**: Proposed an adversarial autoencoder model for a more compact representation for normal data.

**Measurements of Three-Level Hierarchical Structure in the Outliers in the Spectrum of Deepnet Hessians** [[link]()]    
*Vardan Papyan*     

**Refined Complexity of PCA with Outliers** [[link](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/simonov19a/simonov19a.pdf)]    
*Kirill Simonov, Fedor Fomin, Petr Golovach, Fahad Panolan*   

## Year 2018
**Open Category Detection with PAC Guarantees** [[link](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=2115)]    
*Si Liu, Risheek Garrepalli, Thomas Dietterich, Alan Fern, Dan Hendrycks*    
> - **Theory**: A finite sample guarantee on unsupervised anomaly detection.
